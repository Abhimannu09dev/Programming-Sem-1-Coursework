# Programming-Sem-1-Coursework
## Introduction
In this programming scenario, we are tasked with creating a system to manage information about teachers, lecturers, and tutors within an educational institution. The design involves implementing three classes: Teacher, Lecturer, and Tutor, each with specific attributes and methods to encapsulate relevant information about the individuals. The Teacher class serves as the base class, while the Lecturer and Tutor classes inherit from it, demonstrating the principles of object-oriented programming.
